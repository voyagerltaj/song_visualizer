Abstract graphical visualization of the fluctiating amplitude in songs uploaded by the user using raymarching techniques in glsl shaders. Made in about 2 days.

The shaders are used to render a hypnotic display of octahedrons that spiral around the center of the screen. Using the responsive UI elements, the user may upload any audio file they like and it will be sampled to generate a unique modification of the pattern as it plays. Each audio's length and varying amplitude will influence both the colors and pulse/waves of the various octahedrons.
